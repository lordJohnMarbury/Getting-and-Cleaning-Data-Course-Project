## Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project

This is my submission for the Getting and Cleaning data course project.

To run this project you need to download and unzip files from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip


Leave all files in the order they are unzipped and set your working directory to the top directory that is created.

When this is done run the run_analysis.R script. Note that the reshape2 package is needed. It can be downloaded from CRAN.

More information can be found in the code book.
