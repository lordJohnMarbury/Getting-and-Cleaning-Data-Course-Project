## Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project

This is my submission for the Getting and Cleaning data course project.

To run this project you need to download and unzip files from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

The files that are needed are
* features.txt
* subject_train.txt
* X_train.txt
* y_train.txt
* subject_test.txt
* X_test.txt
* y_test.txt

Leave all files in the order they are unzipped.
